## Component Breakdown

### `MainFolder` Component

The `MainFolder` component is the main component of the quiz application. It manages the state and logic for fetching and displaying questions, handling user answers, and tracking the score.

#### State Variables

- `Data`: Stores the array of quiz questions fetched from the API.
- `QuestionIndex`: Keeps track of the current question index.
- `correct_ans`: Stores the correct answer of the current question.
- `incorrect_ans`: Stores the incorrect answer selected by the user.
- `Count`: Tracks the number of correct answers.
- `length`: Boolean flag to indicate if the quiz is completed.
- `color`: Stores the color for displaying the final score.
- `MixAns`: Stores the shuffled answers for the current question.

#### useEffect

- Fetches quiz questions from the API on component mount and sets the `Data` state.
- Shuffles the answers whenever the current question changes.

#### Functions

- `shuffle(array)`: Shuffles an array using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.
- `AnswerHandler(correct, DisplayQuestion, index)`: Handles user's answer selection, updates the score, and moves to the next question after a delay.
- `setNextQuestion()`: Moves to the next question.
- `setBackQuestion()`: Moves to the previous question.
- `ResetQuiz()`: Resets the quiz to the initial state.

## Styling

The component includes inline styling for various elements like questions, answers, and buttons to provide basic UI.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance UI/UX with better styling and animations.
- Add different categories and difficulty levels for the quiz.
- Implement user authentication and store quiz results in a database.
